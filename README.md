**Database Management System**: This application is work with popular DBMS MySQL.
#How to Run the Application
->Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system, if not already installed.
->Set up a compatible database management system (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.) and create a database for the application.
->Download or clone the project repository from [repository URL].
->Open the project in an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
->Configure the database connection details in the application, including the database URL, username, and password.
->Build the project to compile the source code and resolve any dependencies.
->Run the application, and the menu-driven interface will be displayed.
#Usage
Upon launching the application, users will be presented with a menu of options to choose from. They can navigate through the menu by entering the corresponding option number. The available options include:

**Create Account**: Users can select this option to create a new bank account. They will be prompted to enter their personal information.

**User Login**: Registered users can log in to their accounts by selecting this option. They will need to provide their credentials (username and password) to access their account functionalities.

**Transfer Money**: This option allows users to transfer funds between their own accounts or to other users' accounts within the banking system. Users will be guided through the necessary steps to complete the transaction securely.

**View Balance**: Users can choose this option to view the current balance of their accounts. The application will display the balance on the screen.

**Logout**: Users can log out from their accounts by selecting this option. It ensures the protection of their sensitive information and terminates their session.

The application will communicate with the database to perform the requested operations, and the results will be displayed to the user. If any errors or exceptions occur, the application will handle them gracefully and provide appropriate error messages.
